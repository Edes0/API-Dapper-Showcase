In this project Handlers are placed that for example handle business validation of certain entities getting created for example. 
Helpers are also placed in this project. 
Business rule validation should be added in this project. For example if you atempt to delete an entity and want to make sure
that underlying entities are not existing you could have a rule for that. 

The business project is the central place for business rules.

Example folder structure:
- Handlers
- Helpers
- Interfaces (if needed)
- Models (if needed)
- Validation (All business rules goes here - A business rule is for example -> You can't delete a Mimbly if it has an age above 5).
